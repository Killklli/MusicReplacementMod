# Music Replacement Mod (OoT)

This mod allows music in Ocarina of Time to be replaced with external audio files. (Like .MP3 or .OGG)

## Usage

Put the mod's zip file in your `mods` folder. **DO NOT extract it!**
Next to the zip file, create a folder named `music`.

Simply add your MP3, OGG, FLAC or WAV files inside the `music` folder and make sure they are named as follows: `1A-loop.mp3`
- `1A` represents the music ID from the game you want to replace with this audio file. A list of music IDs from Ocarina of Time can be found at: https://wiki.cloudmodding.com/oot/Music_Sequences

- `loop` represents if the audio file should loop. Set it to `noloop` if you don't want the music to loop. Looping should be used for background music, while fanfares or ocarina songs should not be looping.

- `.mp3` is the file extension of your audio file and can be different. You shouldn't touch it at all when renaming your file.
